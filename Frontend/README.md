### MERN Stack Ecommerce Project

This ecommerce website uses the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Let's break down how each part of the stack works for the website:

### 1. **Technology Stack:**

- **MongoDB:** A flexible, NoSQL database used to store product information, user details, and order history. It's scalable, making it perfect for handling large amounts of data.

- **Express.js:** A server-side framework for Node.js that helps us handle API requests efficiently. It helps manage routes and interact with the database.

- **React.js:** A library used for building the user interface (UI). It allows us to create reusable components, making the website fast and interactive. React’s virtual DOM ensures smooth updates for the user.

- **Node.js:** A runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript on the server. It handles the server logic, executes backend scripts, and connects with the database.

### 2. **Back-End Development (Node.js & Express.js):**

We set up the server using Node.js and Express.js to manage incoming requests and send responses. This back-end setup allows us to create RESTful APIs to handle user authentication, product management, shopping cart, and order processing.

### 3. **Front-End Development (React.js):**

For the front-end, we use React.js to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. The website’s structure is modular, with reusable components. React Router helps manage navigation between different pages without reloading.

### 4. **User Authentication (Passport.js or JWT):**

To protect users’ accounts, we implement either session-based authentication (Passport.js) or stateless authentication (JWT). This allows users to securely log in, register, and access protected routes.

### 5. **Product Management and Database (MongoDB):**

We design a MongoDB schema to store product information like name, description, price, images, and stock status. Admins can add, update, or remove products via APIs.

### 6. **Shopping Cart and Checkout:**

Users can add items to their shopping cart, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout. During checkout, users provide shipping info, select payment methods, and complete the purchase through secure payment gateways like PayPal or Stripe.

### 7. **Third-Party Integrations:**

We integrate third-party services for payment processing, shipping, and geolocation. These integrations provide users with payment options, real-time shipping updates, and location-based services.

### 8. **State Management (Redux or Context API):**

We use Redux or React's Context API to manage application-wide data like the shopping cart and user details. This helps keep the user experience smooth and consistent across the website.

### 9. **Front-End Testing (Jest and React Testing Library):**

We write unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the website’s components work properly. These tests verify user interactions, API calls, and state management.

### Functional Requirements (What the Website Should Do):

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Users can register and log in with unique credentials.
   - After logging in, users can access their personalized accounts.

2. **Product Catalog:**
   - The website displays a catalog of products, including details like name, description, price, and images.
   - Products are categorized and easy to search for.

3. **Shopping Cart and Checkout:**
   - Users can add items to their cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.
   - During checkout, users provide shipping info and select payment methods.

4. **Order Management:**
   - Users can view order history and track current orders.
   - Admins can process orders, update statuses, and generate invoices.

5. **Payment Gateway Integration:**
   - The website securely processes payments via gateways like PayPal or credit cards.

6. **Customer Reviews and Ratings:**
   - Users can leave reviews and ratings for products they’ve purchased.
   - Average product ratings help guide new buyers.

7. **Product Recommendations:**
   - The website suggests products based on user behavior and purchase history.

8. **Wishlist and Favorites:**
   - Users can add products to a wishlist for future reference.

9. **Inventory Management:**
   - The website tracks product availability and notifies users of stock levels.

10. **Order Confirmation and Email Notifications:**
    - Users receive email confirmations for orders and updates on shipping or delivery.

---

### Non-Functional Requirements (How the Website Should Perform):

1. **Performance:**
   - The website should load quickly, even with many users browsing at the same time.

2. **Security:**
   - Personal and payment data should be securely stored and encrypted.
   - The site should be protected against common attacks like SQL injections and cross-site scripting (XSS).

3. **Scalability:**
   - The system should handle increasing traffic and a growing product catalog without slowing down.

4. **Accessibility:**
   - The website should be usable by people with disabilities, following accessibility guidelines.

5. **Reliability and Availability:**
   - The website should be online and available 24/7 with minimal downtime.

6. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - The website should be easy to navigate and use, providing a positive user experience.

7. **Compliance:**
   - The website must comply with industry standards and legal regulations like GDPR for data protection.

8. **Backup and Recovery:**
   - Regular backups should be taken to prevent data loss, and a recovery plan should be in place in case of failure.

9. **Performance Monitoring and Analytics:**
   - Tools should be in place to monitor the website's performance and collect data for future improvements.

# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
